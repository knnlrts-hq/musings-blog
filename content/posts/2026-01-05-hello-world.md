## This has been long overdue.
I've been meaning to start a blog for years now. It has been patiently sitting somewhere on the bottom of my stale side-projects list (which I lovingly maintain, but unfortunately rarely execute on).
And then... AI happened. Specifically, the recent wave of agentic coding tools that can turn "hey I have an idea" into "this exists now" between 2 sips of your favorite drink.
And poof! Blogging suddenly became something I could actually ship in between everything else life requires of me.
So here we are. One small item checked off. The rest of my to-do/wishlist is still enormous, but today it's slightly less embarrassing.

This will be a personal musings and deep-thoughts blog about whatever I'm currently thinking about, which tends to cluster around:
- Product Management
- Software engineering
- Math
- Finance
- Philosophy

...not necessarily in that order, and not necessarily with clean boundaries between them.

Sometimes you'll get a well-articulated post. Sometimes I will be rambling on like a madman. Sometimes a small code snippet. Sometimes a quote that made me pause mid-scroll and stare dramatically into the distance.
I may post a lot. I may post nothing. You might love it. You might leave immediately (respect). Either way, welcome.
This blog is mostly my personal sense-making: notes from the stream(s) of consciousness we're all floating in. Yes, there will be a philosophical bent. Run while you still can.

## The origin story
Of course I have been immersed in and tinkering with AI and LLMs for some time now, but something shifted over the 2025 Christmas holidays in 2025. The collective mood changed shortly after the releases of Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2: agentic workflows went from "mostly hype" to "hold my beer, this actually works". Language models are getting exceedingly good at long-running tasks, when supported by the correct tools.
Like every sensible amateur with some spare vacation time, I sat down to investigate more closely; equal parts curiosity and skepticism.
And wow. It's been a wonderful rollercoaster ride. This stuff is genuinely powerful.
My honest hope is that it stays useful for a while, before the usual gravitational forces of corporate politics, incentives, pricing, and strategy decks turn today's shiny tools into tomorrow's carefully rationed features. (Sorry. I'm an economist by training. The reflex is hard to suppress).
Still: right now? It's very exciting.

Here's the part that feels mildly absurd to me: five minutes before this website existed, it didn't. Then I fired up Claude Code (but I'm sure any other coding agent could do) and typed the following prompt:

> Hey Claude, what's up? 
> Please use your skills to help me brainstorm and then implement a clean, minimalist blog that can be hosted as a single HTML file using inline JavaScript and CSS. No React.
> Load dependencies from a CDN. Keep it small.
> Make it easy to add new blog posts, quotes, snippets, and multi-part tutorial posts.
> Once we're aligned, create a design doc and implement it.
> Provide the configuration to host on GitHub Pages.

That's it. The cat is out of the bag. And it is not ever going back in. If you're a blogging platform vendor reading this: I'm sorry. I truly am. But also... this is just one single HTML file. I guess the "SaaSpocalypse" is real after all.

If you read the above prompt and thought, "I have no idea what any of that means", well then congratulations: you have just discovered one of the reasons why software engineering will still be around for a long time to come.
The tools are getting wildly powerful, but awareness, context and experience matter more than ever. The software engineer of the future will not just "generate code"; they will be tuned in: guiding, shaping, validating, and owning the outcome.
And honestly, I like that. The purpose of technology is to eliminate human drudgery. If we can automate the boring parts and spend more time on deeply thinking, building, teaching, and creating... that feels like a very large win to me.

## Before you go
I'm not a professional writer. My writing style will be very inconsistent. It tends to mirror what I'm currently reading or doing. I write when I have something to explore, something to share, or when I'm bored.
I'm not going to do heavyweight research for every single post, but I will do my best to make genuinely interesting posts instead of walls of unstructured text (which I am extremely capable of creating).
I will try to be correct as much as I can. And when I'm wrong, I'll treat it as part of the public learning loop rather than an identity crisis.
That's it. This is officially my first post. This blog exists now, which means I have fewer excuses and more responsibility, which is the kind of trade I apparently enjoy making.
Welcome. Let's see what happens next.
