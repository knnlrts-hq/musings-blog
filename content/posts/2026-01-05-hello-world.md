## This has been long overdue.

I've been meaning to start a blog for years now. It has been sitting somewhere on the bottom of my stale side-projects list, which I lovingly maintain, but unfortunately rarely executed on.
And then... AI happened. Specifically: the recent wave of agentic coding tools that can turn "I have an idea" into "this exists" somewhere between 2 sips of your favorite drink.
Suddenly, blogging stopped being a stale side-project for me and became something I could actually ship inbetween the cracks of everything else life requires of me.
So here we are. One small item checked off. The rest of my to-do/wishlist is still ginormous, but today it's slightly less embarrassing.

This will be a personal musings and deep-thoughts blog about whatever I'm currently thinking about, which tends to cluster around:
- Software engineering
- Math
- Finance
- Philosophy
...not necessarily in that order, and not necessarily with clean boundaries between them.

Sometimes you'll get a well-articulated post. Sometimes I will be raving and rambling like a madman. Sometimes a small code snippet. Sometimes a quote that made me pause mid-scroll and stare dramatically into the distance.
I may post a lot. I may post nothing. You might love it. You might leave immediately (respect). Either way, welcome.
This is just one more voice drifting through the endless internet content void saying, "I think I know what I'm talking about". Spoiler: I don't. Not consistently, anyway.
This blog is mostly my personal sense-making: notes from the stream(s) of consciousness we're all floating in. Yes, there will be a philosophical bent. Run while you still can.

## The origin story
Over the Christmas holidays in 2025, something seemed to shift. To me it felt like the collective mood changed: agentic workflows went from "hype" to "wait, this actually works".
Like every sensible amateur, I sat down to investigate the agentic coding wave more closely; equal parts curiosity and skepticism.
And wow. It's been a wonderful rollercoaster ride. This stuff is genuinely powerful.
My honest hope is that it stays useful for a while, before the usual gravitational forces of corporate incentives, pricing, enshittification, and strategy decks turn today's shiny tools into tomorrow's carefully rationed features. (Sorry. I'm an economist by training. The reflex is hard to suppress.)
Still: right now? It's exciting.
Here's the part that still feels mildly absurd: fifteen minutes before this site existed, it didn't. Then I fired up Claude Code (but I'm sure any other coding agent could do) and typed:

> Hey Claude, what's up?
> Please use your skills to help me brainstorm and then implement a clean, minimalist blog that can be hosted as a single HTML file using inline JavaScript and CSS. No React.
> Load dependencies from a CDN. Keep it small.
> Make it easy to add new blog posts, quotes, snippets, and multi-part tutorial posts.
> Once we're aligned, create a design doc and implement it.
> Provide the configuration to host on GitHub Pages.

That's it. There. The cat is out of the bag. And it is not ever going back in.
If you're a blogging platform vendor reading this: I'm sorry. I truly am. But also... this is just one single HTML file. I guess the "saaspocalypse" is real after all.

If you read the above prompt and thought, "I have no idea what any of that means", well then congratulations: you have just discovered one of the reasons why software development will still be around for a long time to come.
The tools are getting wildly powerful, but awareness and context still matter more than ever. The software engineer of the future won't just "generate code"; they'll be tuned in: guiding, shaping, validating, and owning the outcome.
And honestly, I like that.
One of my favorite ideas is that the purpose of technology is to eliminate human drudgery. If we can automate the boring parts and spend more time on thinking, building, teaching, and creating... that feels like a win to me.

## Before you go
A key point: my writing style will be very inconsistent. It tends to mirror what I'm currently reading. I write when I have something to explore, something to share, or when I'm bored.
I'm not a professional writer. I'm not going to do heavyweight research for every post, but I will my best to post something without turning into a wall of unstructured text (which I am extremely capable of creating).
I will try to be correct as much as I can. And when I'm wrong, I'll treat it as part of the public learning loop rather than an identity crisis.
That's it. This is officially my first post. This blog exists now, which means I have fewer excuses and more responsibility, which is the kind of trade I apparently enjoy making.
Welcome. Let's see what happens next.
